# :male_detective: Archive

Hello, this is ```amirhnajafiz``` archive organization. In this orgaization you can find my old repositories
and my test projects. Everything in here is old and antique. I implemented them in past, therefore
they may not be updated.

## :older_man: :newspaper_roll: What do I have here?

From basic ```c``` programming language projects to software ```design patterns```, all of the repositories
in this organization belong to a project that I got in the past.

## :technologist: Why?

Took keep my old memories.
